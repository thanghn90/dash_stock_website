# Dash Stock Website Template and Mockup
Template and mockup for a stock website developed with python DASH plotly. This is a part of one of my private project. Of course, the core algorithm to crawl and prepare stock data is not public. This is mainly for demonstration purpose. If you plan to build the frond-end of a stock analysis website with python DASH plotly, I hope you find this repo useful.

To run this, you will need python 3, dash, dash-bootstrap-components, and pandas. I highly recommend using VS code over conda. Then run ss_frontend.py and point your browser to 127.0.0.1:8050 to view the website.

Right now, it's a multi-page dash app with some basic UI elements, such as buttons, search dropdown, table with highlighting and clickable rows. A stock website will undoubtedly need much more than this. However, something as simple as a search dropdown may be more complicated than what you would expect.

I also include my [note](https://github.com/thanghn90/dash_stock_website/blob/main/notes/Dash.txt) that logs my findings and references as I build this website.
