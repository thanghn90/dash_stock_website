20230429: A bit later:
Use dbc.DropdownMenuItem for anything that's clickable. Works by default with dbc.Table.
For tooltip, it works with any dash component. However, it's not resizable.
To make a html.Img scale to full width of a dbc.Col, add style={'width': '100%'} to html.Img, NOT width='100%'!!!

20230429: Note about dcc.dropdown menu styling. I forgot to write this before:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56402207/style-dash-components-with-dark-theme-bootstrap-css
One additional thing: add:
.Select-noresults {
    background-color: #000 !important;
}
into the dropdown.css. This will make "no result found" black background as well.
Found that out by using Firefox's Inspector. Note: you need to set a delay in Firefox debug console since the dropdown will close immediately after you click anywhere.

Need to type "allow pasting" into the console to be able to copy/paste commands.


Capable of doing all what we're asking for (regarding making a webapp), in python:
- have all UI elements (buttons, image, graph (via plotly - which looks really nice), search input box (it's an input field))
- have "pages" similar to "routes" in flask, and the URL can be variable (e.g. /stock/VCB, /stock/AGB can be generated from a single stock.py "page", with VCB and AGB as a "variable" input agrument)

Need to construct/update dropdown menu while user are typing
Looks like it's simply a dcc.Dropdown. "searchable" flag is true by default!
Though, we will need to set "clearable" to false - don't want users to accidentally clear ALL the dropdown dict!

Pay attention to Dynamic options and Components as option Label - it's totally possiblet to include images and/or bold text/string while typing in the search dropdown.

- adsense:
looks like it's a bit harder than it looks. We need to modify the top part (<head> or <title>) of index_string of a dash app to invoke the adsense script.
May need to have some html.Script section if we want to show ads in the middle of the webpage.
